/*  I refactored this to be a sub component for the new SelectionForm component.
		Once again I realized that to keep the code DRY I needed to refactor the selection
		components to make them more reusable.  This now gets passed into Selection form
		to render the proper content for the select form elements.
		---The main reason why there is still this component and the IntlSelectForm is
		because I couldn't get the crypto.name to render conditionally while being mapped.
